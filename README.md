# 🏠 House Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts residential house sale prices using **Linear Regression** based on key property features.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **File:** `HousePricePrediction.csv`
- **Total Records:** 2,919 rows
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (house sale price in USD)

### 📋 Features Used

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `MSSubClass` | Type of dwelling involved in the sale |
| `MSZoning` | General zoning classification |
| `LotArea` | Lot size in square feet |
| `LotConfig` | Lot configuration |
| `BldgType` | Type of building |
| `OverallCond` | Overall condition rating of the house |
| `YearBuilt` | Original construction year |
| `YearRemodAdd` | Remodel year |
| `Exterior1st` | Exterior covering on house |
| `BsmtFinSF2` | Finished basement area (sq ft) |
| `TotalBsmtSF` | Total basement area (sq ft) |
| `SalePrice` | ✅ Target — Sale price of the house |

## 🔄 Project Workflow

```
1. Load Data
      ↓
2. Data Cleaning       → Handle nulls (fill SalePrice with mean, drop remaining)
      ↓
3. Encoding            → One-hot encode: MSZoning, LotConfig, BldgType, Exterior1st
      ↓
4. Train/Test Split    → 80% train, 20% test (random_state=0)
      ↓
5. Feature Scaling     → StandardScaler on train and test sets
      ↓
6. Model Training      → Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
      ↓
7. Evaluation          → R², MAE, RMSE, MAPE
```

## 📊 Model Results

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| **R² Score** | 0.374 |
| **MAE** | ~30,829 |
| **RMSE** | ~41,138 |
| **MAPE** | ~18.7% |

> ℹ️ The baseline Linear Regression model explains ~37% of the variance in sale prices. Future improvements could include Random Forest or XGBoost for better accuracy.
